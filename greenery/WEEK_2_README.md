### What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again?

#### People that have not purchased the `Money Tree` it should be a big seller. 

### Page View - Questions (that are supported with the fact_page_view table)
+ What are daily page views by product? 
+ Daily orders by product? 
+ Whatâ€™s getting a lot of traffic, but maybe not converting into purchases?

### Order - Questions (that are supported with the fact_order and fact_order_items table)
+ first order? 
+ Last order? 
+ How many orders have they made? 
+ Total spend?

### Explain the product mart models you added: 

I added the following dimension tables to support the following fact tables

+ dim_address
+ dim_date
+ dim_event_type
+ dim_order_status
+ dim_product
+ dim_promo
+ dim_shipping_service
+ dim_user

The following fact tables support orders and order items as well as page views

+ fact_orders
+ fact_order_items
+ fact_page_views

The tables we picked based on the staging tables and creating a holistic view of the data with dimensions for each categorical item. Some dimensions were added from degeneration dimension in the fact tables.
